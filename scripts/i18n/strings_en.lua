			<c:9d7faa>Operator. I recall how much you prefer business before pleasure, so I'll get straight to it. I've identified the key funding sources for Project MesMerize (see attachment). Some are names, others are aliases. Once we figure out what connects these people, we'll have more data on the scope of the project.

			I have a hunch you were right. These contacts are from all over the globe, with deep roots in every corp. The digging I've done so far seems to match up with your conglomerate theory, but full details will have to wait until my next report. If this checks out, it could change everything we thought we knew about how the corps operate.

			I should be able to squeeze at least two more days out of this identity before I get burned. As per the usual: If you don't hear from me again, it's been nice working with you.

		[[INVITATION, 2074 MEGACORP WARE CONGRESS (MWC)

		<c:62B3B3>Dear Mr. Richardson,

		Congratulations! Based on your application and longstanding relationships within Factory-To-Market Wholesalers Ltd. and Kelfried & Odin Weapons Foundry, you have been selected as our guest at the 2074 Megacorp Ware Congress. This exclusive annual event showcases the best technology our partners and their subsidiaries have to offer - the “cream of the corps”, as we like to say. Please review the following information regarding the event. We will be in touch with further details as the expo approaches.</>

		<c:db65ba>About MWC</> - <c:eca35b>“NEXT YEAR'S TECHNOLOGY, TODAY!”</>

		<c:62B3B3>For two days in late September, a group of trailblazing scientists, senior executives, key shareholders, top developers, downstream vendors and trusted market consultants (such as yourself) will come together from around the globe to catch a glimpse of the future. In an exhibit hall nestled within a corporate R&D facility, the corporations' greatest minds will share their state-of-the-art work in lethal and non-lethal weaponry, network interface systems, and human augmentation and enhancement technologies. Prototypes of all kinds will be available for close inspection, scheduled demonstrations and region-specific pre-orders, in accordance with current treaties.
		Spearheaded in 2061 by FTM’s then-Chief Product Officer, now Chief Executive Officer, Sophie Woodbridge, the first Megacorp Ware Congress in San Francisco featured little more than a barely working experimental accelerator chip, the first gunpowder-free sidearm and a low-friction gel with vague augmentation applications. As you no doubt know, the expo soon gained notoriety within the upper echelons of intercorp society when the first functional scanning amp was unveiled to stunned attendees in 2065. Since then, it has expanded beyond FTM’s product line to encompass groundbreaking applied science and industrial design by all megacorps and their subsidiaries, as well as thought leadership and exclusive networking events. Today, the MWC stands unrivalled as *the* annual global technology exposition.</>

		<c:db65ba>Location & Venue</>

		<c:62B3B3>The host of the expo rotates between the corps as a matter of tradition. Due to security breaches in 2073, the location of the 2074 MWC is a closely guarded secret available only to the event’s VIP invitees. We will provide transport beam coordinates shortly before the exhibit hall opens. We remind you that by applying to be a guest, you have accepted the standard nondisclosure agreement regarding corporate facility locations.</>

		<c:63ffca>STEVE:</c> <c:62B3B3>I've been better. Did you get my request?</c>
		
		<c:63ffca>STEVE:</c> <c:62B3B3>It's important.</c>
		
		<c:ff9677>SAYID:</c> <c:62B3B3>Do you mean that upgraded security request?</c>
		
		<c:ff9677>SAYID:</c> <c:62B3B3>What about it?</c>
		
		<c:63ffca>STEVE:</c> <c:62B3B3>....</c>
		
		<c:63ffca>STEVE:</c> <c:62B3B3>Is it approved?</c>
		
		<c:ff9677>SAYID:</c> <c:62B3B3>Well, you know it's not that simple. You haven't conclusively shown that there is increased risk to your person and from whom. Standard stuff.</c>
		
		<c:63ffca>STEVE:</c> <c:62B3B3>I've gotten reports of chatter on the Subnet from *your* team.</c>
		
		<c:ff9677>SAYID:</c> <c:62B3B3>Chatter is chatter, it could be nothing. Terrorists playing mindgames, trying to get us to stretch ourselves thin. Like, say, spending a small fortune on security based on the Subnet rumor mill.</c>
		
		<c:63ffca>STEVE:</c> <c:62B3B3>I don't know about that. You heard about that high-clearance terminal hit recently? All of Gavin's location data, stolen. Something's going on.</c>
		
		<c:ff9677>SAYID:</c> <c:62B3B3>Of course I heard about it.</c>

		<c:ff9677>SAYID:</c> <c:62B3B3>And what?</c>

		<c:63ffca>STEVE:</c> <c:62B3B3>"For sure"? Geez. It's almost like you're *trying* to get me killed.</c>
		
		<c:ff9677>SAYID:</c> <c:62B3B3>Of course not! I'm just trying to do my job. This isn't personal.</c>
		
		<c:63ffca>STEVE:</c> <c:62B3B3>Yeah right. You've had it out for me ever since I got promoted and you didn't. Now you're gonna hang me out to dry??? I could have you reported.</c>
		
		<c:ff9677>SAYID:</c> <c:62B3B3>You're being paranoid - I would never do that. Not lastly because keeping you safe is my goddamn job. But I have to answer for *every* expenditure, same as you. Finance is not gonna be happy with me if we install all that extra tech and nothing happens.</c>
		
		<c:63ffca>STEVE:</c> <c:62B3B3>Isn't nothing happening the point???</c>
		
		<c:ff9677>SAYID:</c> <c:62B3B3>You know what I mean.</c>
		
		<c:63ffca>STEVE:</c> <c:62B3B3>I don't feel safe here.</c>
		
		<c:ff9677>SAYID:</c> <c:62B3B3>Nobody does. But trust me, installing turrets in the corner of every room helps a lot less than you might think.</c>
		
		<c:63ffca>STEVE:</c> <c:62B3B3>Can we do that???</c>
		
		<c:ff9677>SAYID:</c> <c:62B3B3>No.</c>
		
		<c:ff9677>SAYID:</c> <c:62B3B3>We don't even have the finalized SecNet assessment yet.  It could be nothing. Could be a disgruntled janitor, or some idiot temp forgetting to lock the screen. You want to turn your C-suite into Fort Knox over *that*?</c>
		
		<c:63ffca>STEVE:</c> <c:62B3B3>A couple of security upgrades isn't exactly Fort Knox, and most of it is standard countermeasures we already use. I just want more of it. In my office.</c>
		
		<c:ff9677>SAYID:</c> <c:62B3B3>Have you even read your own list? "Two Akuma drones with Seeker ammo"? Laser-grid guarded saferoom? Pressure plates? Tripwires? Half of that is experimental tech, and it'll endanger you and your colleagues more than Subnet "chatter" ever could. Not to mention put a serious dent in your leather couches.</c>
		
		<c:63ffca>STEVE:</c> <c:62B3B3>Ha ha. So funny.</c>
		
		<c:ff9677>SAYID:</c> <c:62B3B3>Look. I get that you're worried, but you've gotta admit it's probably just the stress of the new job. You're not the first exec to discover he's got a fear of heights. Book your PTO, spend a day on a yacht, and try to relax. And lay off the spy novels while you're at it. Alright?</c>
		
		<c:63ffca>STEVE:</c> <c:62B3B3>I don't have a fear of heights. I go wingsuit flying every year.</c>
		
		<c:ff9677>SAYID:</c> <c:62B3B3>I was being metaphorical. </c>
		
		<c:63ffca>STEVE:</c> <c:62B3B3>Sayid. Dude. We go way back, right? Just do this for me, and I'll owe you big. That's a huge chance for you, and you know it. A guy in your position can't be picky about opportunities like that.</c>
		
		<c:ff9677>SAYID:</c> <c:62B3B3>Right...</c>
		
		<c:ff9677>SAYID:</c> <c:62B3B3>Well. Let me remind you that I take my job very seriously, and I would never engage in a quid-pro-quo scheme involving the misuse of corporate funding, especially not on a corp-owned messaging system.</c>
		
		<c:63ffca>STEVE:</c> <c:62B3B3>I'll make it worth your while. We can worry about explaining it to management later, when I'm still alive</c>
		
		<c:ff9677>SAYID:</c> <c:62B3B3>I really can't</c>
		
		<c:ff9677>SAYID:</c> <c:62B3B3>Look... If you're that worried... I'll see if I can get you a side-arm, okay? But anything more, you're going to have to pay for it out of your own pocket. Could try pitching it to the higher-ups as a facility upgrade, maybe they'll reimburse you for part of it. I'm sure you'll figure out a way - guy in your position and all.</c>
		
		<c:63ffca>STEVE:</c> <c:62B3B3>I didn't mean it like that</c>
		
		<c:ff9677>SAYID:</c> <c:62B3B3>I gotta go, alright? Ttyl, catch you on the flipside, be sure to give my regards to Katie</c>
