# More Missions
### A mod for "Invisible, Inc." by Klei Entertainment

The aim of this mod is to add new kinds of missions to the game. 

## Installation

Download the files. If you intend to contribute, or update frequently, consider installing git on your computer and creating a local branch to pull to. (It's pretty straight-forward, look up some tutorials. I recommend using the "git GUI" application where possible.)

You may need to compile some files before the game can run this mod.
scripts.zip - Simply but all the contents of the "scripts" directory directly into a zip file with the same name.
KWAD files - Run the KWAD builder to generate a fresh KWAD file from the raw assets in this repository. View the official modding tutorials for more information.

This mod requires Sim Constructor by Cyberboy2000.

## Contribution

In order to contribute to this repository directly, you need to [make a GitHub account](https://github.com/login).

Then pester a "Maintainer" member of this project to give you the Developer role.
If you are confident with git, you can instead make a fork to work in and send a merge request later.

Finally you can edit and upload files via the website, or you use the git client as mentioned in [Installation](#Installation).

Command line instructions for the git client

```
git config --global user.name "My Username"
git config --global user.email "myaddress@jmail.com"
